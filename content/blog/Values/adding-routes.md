# Obedience

Why don't we always have to understand the Lord's purposes in order to be obedient?

Through obedience to God's commandments we prepare for eternal life and exaltation. Sometimes we don't know why a particular commandment is given to us; however, we demonstrate our faith and trust in God when we obey him despite not understanding the reason.

Adam and Eve were commanded to offer sacrifices to God. One day an angel appeared to Adam and asked him why he offered sacrifices and Adam replied that he did not know what the reason was, that he did it because the Lord had commanded him. (See Moses 5:5–6 and the illustration in this chapter.)

Then the angel taught Adam the gospel and told him about the Savior to come. The Holy Spirit descended on Adam and he prophesied about the inhabitants of the earth to the last generation. (See Moses 5:9–10 ; D&C 107:56 .) Because of his obedience, Adam received this knowledge and great blessings.
