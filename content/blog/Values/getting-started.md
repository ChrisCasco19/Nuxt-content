# Love to neighbor

The love of God and neighbor puts us before the great novelty of Jesus. On the one hand, it reveals to us that these two commandments are the root and foundation on which any Law can be truly sustained. And on the other, that everything, and in particular the Law, remains definitively open to the reality of God and the reality of Neighbor.

In love is the source from which life flows, adoration, joy, availability, simplicity, dedication, service, and especially the care of those who need us most urgently, the poor, the sick, the sad, the helpless.

Love is commonly affection, emotion, empathy and adherence with our whole being. But true love would be unknown if we simply remained in an emotional experience that fails to transform our entire being, or if this love did not translate into concrete works of fraternity and solidarity, which are the test of the veracity of love.
