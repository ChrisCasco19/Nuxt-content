## 1. Keep a prayer journal

Prayer is probably the most essential part of a Christian's life. That is why your prayer life should be treated as a priority. The best way to do this is to keep a prayer journal. Your prayer list should have a designated place.

## 2. Create your categories

The first step you should take when creating your prayer request list is to create different categories. Categories are very helpful so you don't keep praying for the same thing all the time. These also help you cover many different areas.

1. My people: family, friends, coworkers and classmates.
2. Countries: different countries around the world.
3. Lost souls: people who have turned away from God or who have not accepted Christ.
4. Church: members of my church, the Church of Christ.
5. Personal: my finances, work, school, my goals.
6. Sibling Prayer Requests: Any requests you receive from other people to pray.

## 3. Give a one-word reason for each person or item on your lists

Listing different people or items in each category is not enough, you have to ask yourself "Why am I praying for them/this?". This is important because having specific reasons for each person or thing on the list will prevent you from forgetting to pray.

## 4. Research

Find reasons if you don't have them. Sometimes there are categories on your prayer list that you need to know more about in order to give a reason to pray about them. For example, in my category "Countries" I need to educate myself about the different countries in the world and stay up to date with world news to know the situations that each one of them is going through.
